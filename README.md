Essentially this is a challenge presented for front-end development. 
The goal is to utilize SWAPI with React and produce an output given a character's name.

React Coding Challenge
Using the Star Wars API, we would like you to create a React application that allows you to search through a list of characters/people in the Star Wars universe. Use Create React App to initialize your application. To submit your challenge please send an email with your GitHUb repo link containing your solution.

Requirements
1. Each list item should consist of the character's name, gender, hair color, mass, and height.
2. The list should be styled in a way that makes each entry distinct.
3. The list should be searchable by the character's name.
4. The list should have pages (the maximum amount of entries on a page should be 10).
5. The displayed list should be displayed alphabetically.
6. Below the list, display the average height and average mass of the characters in your list (calculate this using the reduce method).

EXAMPLE
Luke SkywalkerGender: Male Hair Color: Blond Height: 172 Mass: 77

C-3POGender: n/a Hair Color: n/a Height: 167 Mass: 75

Average Height: 170Average Mass: 76
